# Website-Crawler-Chatbot
The Website Crawler ChatBot is a Python-based application designed to scrape data from a provided website URL, process the data, and enable a question-answering (QA) experience based on the extracted content. The chatbot leverages litellm for its modular Large Language Model (LLM) implementation to provide intelligent and context-aware responses.
